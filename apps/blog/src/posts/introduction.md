### Old Developer Working With Younger Developer
Hello, Number 1 Son.

Over the next bunch of months, I'm going to spend a part of my day finding and blogging development stuff for you.  Most of these will revolve around Angular, of course.  But I'm also going to discuss general development issues.

The general effort will be to prepare you for consulting opportunities.  I'm also excited to discuss topics that can help you make decisions about direction.  My path is as good as dead... :)

## Why Angular?
You and I have had many discussions around this question.

In the current landscape, React has more momentum than Angular.  Lots of reasons for this.  Of course, Vue is coming around the outside to overtake them both...

For me, Angular is a better fit for my background of backend development.  It is opinionated-- which this generation does not appreciate as much.  I love opinionated.  I like knowing that once I learn what Angular wants me to learn, I'm covered.  If you go through Max's Udemy course on Angular, you've been exposed to just about everything that Angular has to offer.

You have abided my decision-- gracefully, which I appreciate.

## Our Development Near Future
So we will be continuing to build Lubetech's next generation in Angular.  As you can see from this codebase, I'm settling on Nx mono-repos for my future development.  This technology was originally developed by an ex-Angular team-members.  It continues to be Angular friendly; but they are making React and Vue first-class citizens... :)

My intent is to focus my public mono-repo on all of these little projects like GolfMastery, LifeMastery, TypingDrills, BarGames, etc.  The private mono-repo will contain Hiverarchy, this blog, and whatever else I don't want seen by the public.

For the most part, these will both be using Angular, Ionic, Firebase, and NestJs.  As I develop-- and you help build and pretty-up, I'm going to be offering you a bunch of these nuggets.

## Not-So-Near Future
React is not dead to us.  Nx will let us easily add both React and Vue applications whenever we want to.  We will when we are ready.  Learning them both will be much easier for you after you get even stronger.

## Take Away
For most of my career, I've been a C# / Microsoft developer.  There has always been a massive amount of work for me.  But about 3/4 of the way through it, I found out that our competition Java, was the huge leader in "opportunities".  I didn't even know any Java developers.  Angular is that way.  And, if we feel any differently, we can easily move towards what is next... thinking Vue.
