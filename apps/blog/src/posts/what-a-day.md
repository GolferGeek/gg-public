## Playing With Logic Apps and Environments
G'Day Mate!

Fun day playing with our environment files and trying to figure out how to set environment variables
in a multi-tenant application.  We have the logo just about figured out... next is the theme files.  I've been doing
a bit of research on it and we should have it figured out by the end of tomorrow.

It is always funny how this stuff comes full circle!  We have the same issues in my .NET / C# world.  There we have
"appsettings" files... :)  Works almost exactly the same way...

After we get this figured out, you can move pretty smoothly into the UI work that you are so good at.

So now... you understand more about the environment files then the average bear... already we are making
progress!
